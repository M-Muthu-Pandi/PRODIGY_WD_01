# Stopwatch Web Application

A simple and mobile-responsive stopwatch web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project was developed as part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech** and includes essential functionalities such as Start, Pause, Resume, Reset, and Lap recording.


## Features

- **Start**: Begin timing.
- **Pause**: Temporarily stop the timer without resetting it.
- **Resume**: Continue timing from where it was paused.
- **Reset**: Reset the stopwatch to 0.
- **Laps**: Record laps while the stopwatch is running.
- **Mobile Responsive**: The application adjusts to various screen sizes for an optimal user experience on mobile devices.

## Project Structure

- index.html       # HTML file containing the stopwatch structure
- styles.css       # CSS file for styling and responsiveness
- script.js        # JavaScript file for stopwatch functionality
- README.md        # Project documentation (this file)


## How It Works

The stopwatch is controlled by JavaScript, using event listeners to handle user interactions such as starting, pausing, resuming, resetting, and recording laps. The `setInterval` function is used to keep track of the elapsed time.

### Key JavaScript Functions

- **startBtn()**: Starts the stopwatch.
- **pauseBtn()**: Pauses the stopwatch.
- **resumeBtn()**: Resumes the stopwatch from where it was paused.
- **resetBtn()**: Resets the stopwatch to 0.
- **lapBtn()**: Records the current time as a lap.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling and making the app mobile responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For stopwatch functionality, event handling, and lap recording.
